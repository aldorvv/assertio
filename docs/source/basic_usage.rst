Basic Usage
=========


Assertio Configuration
---------
In order to start writing your test cases, there is some configuration that you 
must do.
:code:`assertio` is flexible enough to get som necessary data from different 
sources.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is not any settings file under your project's root, :code:`assertio`
will look for the following environment variables

.. code-block:: text

    ASSERTIO_BASE_URL     # Define the API to be tested url
    ASSERTIO_LOGFILE      # Defaulted to assertio.log will recieve the execution logs
    ASSERTIO_PAYLOADS_DIR # Defaulted to features/payloads will define the local directory
                          # to .json files that can be used while executing requests


:code:`ASSERTIO_BASE_URL` **must** exist if there is not a settings file, otherwise
the tests won't run.


assertio.json file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:code:`assertio` Will look for this settings file in your poject's root,
the structure of this file should be like this

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "base_url": "your-api-url",
        "logfile": "assertio.log",
        "payloads_dir": "features/payloads"
    }

If any key is missing, :code:`assertio` will try to replace it with the environment
variables mentioned above, using the same default values.


assertio.yaml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are a fan of :code:`yaml` files, :code:`assertio` can be setup using this settings
file in your poject's root, the structure of this file should be like this

.. code-block:: yaml
    
    base_url: your-api-url
    logfile: assertio.log
    payloads_dir: features/payloads

If any key is missing, :code:`assertio` will try to replace it with the environment
variables mentioned above, using the same default values.


Runners
---------

:code:`assertio` has a Runner class in order to create child classes
to hold all your test cases, to create a new Runner it is important to
add a new runner file within :code:`features/runners` folder.

Your new child class name **must** end with *Runner* suffix, otherwise
it wont be reachable from :code:`assertio` CLI.


.. code-block:: python


    # features/runners/example.py
    from asserito import Runner
    
    class BookRunner(Runner):
        
        def test_get_books(self):
            ...

        def test_post_book(self):
            ...

        def test_patch_book(self):
            ...

        def test_delete_book(self):
            ...

 

It's worth to mention that all your test cases **must** start with **test**
prefix in order to be executed.


Start a set of tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have defined your *Runners* run them is as easy as just invoke the
:code:`.start()` method.

.. code-block:: python

    # main.py
    from features.runners.book import BookRunner
    from features.runners.author import AuthorRunner

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        BookRunner().start()
        AuthorRunner().start()


Creating Request() chains
-------------------------

:code:`assertio` also has a Request class with all the necessary methods to

 - Setup http request body, headers, method, endpoint
 - Perform a http request
 - Assert a lot of data of the http response

This can be done using a *chain-like syntax* which will make the test easier to
read, understand and modify.

.. code-block:: python


    # features/runners/example.py
    from asserito import Runner
    
    class BookRunner(Runner):
        
        def test_get_books(self):
            Request()\
                .to("/api/v1/books/")
                .with_method("GET")\
                .perform()\
                .assert_http_ok()

This test above will execute the next steps one by one:
    - Creates a new request
    - Sets the request endpoint to :code:`/api/v1/books/`
    - Sets request method to :code:`GET`
    - Executes the requets and store the response
    - Asserts that response status code equals :code:`HTTP OK 200`


Assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But, you can assert many more information about your request, let's take a look
to a little more complex example.

.. code-block:: python


    # features/runners/example.py
    from asserito import Runner
    
    class BookRunner(Runner):
        
        def test_get_books(self):
            Request()\
                .to("/api/v1/books/")
                .with_method("GET")\
                .perform()\
                .assert_http_ok()\
                .assert_response_field("results")\
                .is_not_empty()

Now, this Request chain will execute the same steps as above and will assert
that the response's json body field :code:`results` is not an empty array.

All the assertions **must** be invoked after :code:`.perform()`.

Otherwise an exception will be raised.


Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far, we have been talking about how to assert information from a http response,
but your Request object allows you to do more than that.

Let's take a look to a different example using more request preconditions.

.. code-block:: python


    # features/runners/example.py
    from asserito import Runner
    
    DEFAULT_HEADERS = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    BOOK_PAYLOAD = {
        "id": 144,
        "title": "The Divine Comedy", 
        "author": {
            "id": 12,
            "name": "Dante Alighieri",
            "nationality": "Italian"
        }, 
        "year": 1472
    }

    class BookRunner(Runner):
        
        def test_post_book(self):
            Request()\
                .to("/api/v1/books/")
                .with_method("POST")\
                .with_headers(DEFAULT_HEADERS)\
                .with_body(BOOK_PAYLOAD)\
                .perform()\
                .assert_http_created()\
                .assert_response_field("author.name")\
                .equals("Dante Alighieri")


This test above will execute the next steps one by one:
    - Creates a new request
    - Sets the request endpoint to :code:`/api/v1/books/`
    - Sets request method to :code:`POST`
    - Sets request headers to :code:`DEFAULT_HEADERS` dictionary
    - Sets request payload to :code:`BOOK_PAYLOAD` dictionary
    - Asserts that response's status code equals :code:`HTTP CREATED 201`
    - Asserts that response's json body field :code:`author.name` field equals "Dante Alighieri"

As you might have guessed, all the preconditions **must** be invoked before
invoking :code:`.perform()`.


Quick tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Skipping one line**

When defining a new request :code:`method` can be added to :code:`Request()`
initial line.

.. code-block:: python

    # features/runners/example.py
    from asserito import Runner
    
    class BookRunner(Runner):
        
        def test_get_books(self):
            Request("GET")\
                .to("/api/v1/books/")
                .perform()\
                .assert_http_ok()

Will work exactly the same as the previous request, this might help you to save
one chain member!

**Using data from .json files.**

Sometimes you might need to add huge payloads to your request, full of static
data, therefore, :code:`assertio` allows you to load a json file when using 
:code:`.with_body()`, just add the name as parameter! As long as your .json file
exists within :code:`features/payloads` :code:`assertio` will find it!
Let's see an example


.. code-block:: json
    :caption: features/payloads/api/book.json

    {
        "id": 144,
        "title": "The Divine Comedy", 
        "author": {
            "id": 12,
            "name": "Dante Alighieri",
            "nationality": "Italian"
        }, 
        "year": 1472
    }

.. code-block:: python

    class BookRunner(Runner):
        
        def test_post_book(self):
            Request("POST")\
                .to("/api/v1/books/")
                .with_headers(DEFAULT_HEADERS)\
                .with_body("api/book.json")\
                .perform()\
                .assert_http_created()\
                .assert_response_field("author.name")\
                .equals("Dante Alighieri")

Should work just the same as the previous POST example!


Assertio CLI (WIP)
---------
:code:`assertio` has a CLI as well!

Once you have defined your runners under :code:`features/runners`, you can run 
all of them using:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Within your virtualenv

    $ assertio

Runnig this command will execute all the tests for each class with the :code:`Runner`
suffix, but you can always choose just one using the :code:`--run` flag

.. code-block:: bash

    $ assertio --run BookRunner

Will run only the BookRunner defined.

Using the :code:`assertio` command will execute runners using the default settings
mentioned above, looking for either :code:`assertio.json` or `assertio.yaml` files
in your project's root or using the defined environment variables.

But you can also specify wich settings file to use with the :code:`--settings` 
this might be useful when you work with more that one API environment, you can 
easily switch between testing dev environment API to uat environment API!


.. code-block:: bash

    $ assertio --run BookRunner --settings=dev.json
    $ assertio --run BookRunner --settings=uat.json

Will execute the same test set just changing the url and other settings already 
metioned!


Hope this basic usasge was useful for you to start testing your APIs! ðŸš€
